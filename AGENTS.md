# AGENTS.md — Rúnir (product)

Standalone HTTP memory service. Clients call it; it does not orchestrate agents.

**Beads (this repo only):** tracker DB name is **`runir_product`** on the machine shared Dolt (`127.0.0.1:3308`). Prefix `Rúnir-`. Do **not** open issues against the forge archive (`~/Code/runir-archive`) — that lab tracker is retired for product work.

**Plugins:** `plugins/runir-claudecode`, `plugins/runir-codex`, `plugins/runir-pi` (thin HTTP clients).

**Service:** default local dogfood `:7700` via launchd Option A (`~/Library/Application Support/runir/`).

<!-- bd-doctor-divergence: ok -->

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

> **Architecture in one line:** Issues live in a local Dolt database

## Machine ops (shared agent-ops)

Long-lived Beads + Dolt on the shared server (`com.beads.shared-dolt`, `127.0.0.1:3308`). **Database:** `runir_product`.

- **Closeout Dolt push:** `bd-dolt-push-safe --repo "$PWD"` (from `~/Code/agent-ops` → `~/.local/bin`)
- **Grok multi-stage runs:** machine-global `workgraph` at `~/.grok/workflows/` (owned by agent-ops; install via `~/Code/agent-ops/install.sh`). Human launcher: `workgraph "task…"` / `workgraph auto "…"` / `workgraph --run "…"`. Intent router: `workgraph-intent` (pre-launch shape only — does not rewrite a running graph). Babysit: `watch-workgraph --run-dir <wf_dir> --mode watch`.
- **workgraph closeout when ship=true:** Dolt push, then **git commit + git push** of product changes — do not leave shipped work uncommitted for the human.
- **Ops contract / recovery:** `~/Code/agent-ops/AGENTS.md` and `~/Code/agent-ops/docs/` — not a Leit product surface; no Workspace Execution / GraphQL ownership here.
- **Workflow graph principles:** `~/Code/agent-ops/docs/workflow-graph-hardening-plan.md` and `~/Code/agent-ops/templates/workflow-design-principles.md` — thin orchestrator + capped review; do not invent unbounded multi-reviewer graphs.

Do not copy agent-ops scripts into this repo. Do not pin `.grok/workflows/workgraph.rhai` unless intentional product divergence.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
