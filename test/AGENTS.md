# Tests DOX - Test Suites And Fixtures

## Purpose

Primary Vitest and Python tests plus local fixtures for service behavior, hooks, plugins, schemas, storage, recall, capture, and harness helpers.

## Ownership

- Root `*.test.ts`: service, plugin, route, schema, hook, capture, recall, and storage tests.
- `integration/`: integration tests that may require external/local dependencies.
- `fixtures/`: test-only transcript/event/scenario fixtures.
- `helpers/`: shared test helpers.

## Local Contracts

- Tests should exercise behavior through the same surface clients use when the user asks for integration evidence.
- Raw integration artifacts must preserve exactly what the system produces; do not add presentation wrappers.
- Do not mark dependency tests as skipped simply because Docker/Ollama/service is down; start required services or report a real startup blocker.
- Mock only mapping/hydration or controlled unit seams; DB/service behavior belongs in the service.
- Sourcea lineage native tests may start only an owned loopback ephemeral Surreal memory process with synthetic data, must exercise actual schema/parser/wrapper behavior, and must terminate the process in cleanup. They are opt-in and must not fall back to an operator endpoint.
- Sourcea delivery positives must use the fixed source-owned synthetic resolver; request-shaped flags, copied evidence, and serialized evidence are refusal fixtures. Backlog schema tests must call `ensureStalenessBacklogTable` itself for absent, idempotent, partial, incompatible, and extra hierarchy cases.

## Work Guidance

- Read root AGENTS.md `Test Dependencies` before integration tests.
- Read `docs/agent-guidance/verification-and-release.md` before deciding quality gates.
- Keep fixtures minimal and explicit about the contract they lock.

## Verification

- Run the specific test file(s) changed.
- For broad test infrastructure changes, run `npm run test:ci` or `npm run check` when warranted.
- Schema fixture changes may require `npm run test:schema:events`.
- `test/**` is lint-covered (Rúnir-u2we removed it from the eslint ignore list); `npm run lint` must stay clean here. `src/__tests__/**` remains eslint-ignored.
